#### subsets
 No. of subsets of a set = 2^n
- this is also known as no. of cardinality of power set

**surjective** - onto
**injective** - on:one
**bijective** - one:one, onto

#### fog(x) -> f(g(x))
f: A -> B
g: B -> C

- if `gof(x)` is one:one, then it is mandatory that `g` is one:one
- if `gof(x)` is onto, then it is mandatory that `f` is onto
