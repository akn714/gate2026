##### Bounded wait
Bounded wait is a condition in operating system process synchronization ensuring that a process requesting access to a critical section will not wait indefinitely. It limits the number of times _other_ processes can enter their critical sections after a process makes a request, preventing starvation.
##### Starvation
Starvation in an operating system (OS) is when a process is repeatedly denied necessary resources (like CPU time) indefinitely, often because higher-priority processes keep arriving, preventing it from ever running, a problem common in priority-based scheduling.
